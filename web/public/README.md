# Hero Image Placeholder

The Hero component now expects an image at:
`/public/hero-mockup.png`

## What to do:

1. **Option 1: Screenshot Dashboard** (Recommended)
   - Run the app (`npm run dev`)
   - Go to `/dash` page
   - Take a screenshot of the full dashboard
   - Save as `hero-mockup.png` in this folder

2. **Option 2: Use Stock Image**
   - Use a laptop mockup generator like:
     - https://mockuphone.com
     - https://smartmockups.com
   - Upload a dashboard screenshot
   - Export and save as `hero-mockup.png`

3. **Option 3: Use Generic Laptop Photo**
   - Use the laptop photo you sent
   - Rename to `hero-mockup.png`
   - Place in this folder

## Image Specs:
- **Recommended size**: 1200x900px (4:3 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG or JPEG
- **Max file size**: < 500KB for optimal loading

## Current State:
- Image component is ready in `components/Hero.tsx`
- Uses Next.js Image optimization
- Has blur placeholder
- Decorative gradient overlays added

**For now, the image won't load until you add `hero-mockup.png` to this folder!**
